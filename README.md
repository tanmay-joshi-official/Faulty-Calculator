# Faulty Calculator (JavaScript Mini Project)

A fun and interactive **Faulty Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It behaves like a normal calculator **90% of the time**, but intentionally gives an **incorrect answer 10% of the time** 🤖 to demonstrate the use of **randomization, functions, and conditional statements** in JavaScript.

## 📌 Purpose of the Project

This project was created while learning:

* JavaScript **functions**
* `if`, `else if`, `else` conditions
* Random number generation


## ⚙️ How It Works

* User enters two numbers and chooses an operation ( + , − , × , ÷ )
* A random number decides whether:

  * ✅ Correct calculation is shown (90% chance)
  * ❌ Wrong calculation is shown (10% chance)

This simulates a **faulty system on purpose**.
